**Download the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Desktop image:**

- Visit: <https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/>
- Download the **64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop image** (`ubuntu-22.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso`)

**Installation instructions:**

- Follow the official Ubuntu installation guide: <https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview>
- The guide covers:
  - Creating a bootable USB stick
  - Booting from USB
  - Installation setup and configuration
  - Completing the installation

**System requirements:**

- At least 25GB of storage space
- A flash drive (12GB or above recommended) for the installation media
- At least 1024MiB of RAM

---

### Installing ROS 2 Humble

After installing Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, install ROS 2 Humble on your Remote PC.

**Follow the official ROS 2 installation guide:**

- <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html>

The installation process includes:

1. Setting up locale and sources
2. Installing ROS 2 packages
3. Setting up the environment
4. Installing additional tools (colcon, argcomplete, etc.)

**Quick summary:**

```bash
# Set locale
sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

# Add ROS 2 apt repository
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main"

# Install ROS 2 Humble
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop

# Install development tools
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions python3-argcomplete

# Source ROS 2 setup
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

**Note:** Theoretically, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and ROS 2 Humble are all you need to install. Everything else (TurtleBot3 packages, Navigation2, Explore Lite) is included in the GitHub repository.

---

## Workspace Setup

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository to your workspace directory:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/SleepyFinale/turtlebot3-workspace.git turtlebot3_ws
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
```

This repository contains all the necessary packages for TurtleBot3 autonomous exploration:

- TurtleBot3 core packages (DynamixelSDK, turtlebot3_msgs, turtlebot3)
- Navigation2 configuration
- Explore Lite for autonomous exploration
- Custom launch files and scripts

You can now branch, push, and pull changes as needed for your development workflow.

---

### Building the Workspace

The workspace includes two build scripts to help you build and source everything:

#### `clean_rebuild.sh`

Performs a complete clean rebuild of the entire workspace:

- Removes all build artifacts (`build/`, `install/`, `log/` directories)
- Checks for system dependencies
- Builds all packages from scratch
- Sources the workspace automatically after build

**Usage:**

```bash
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
./clean_rebuild.sh
```

**When to use:**

- First-time setup
- After major changes to multiple packages
- When experiencing build issues that require a clean slate
- After pulling significant changes from the repository

#### `minimal_rebuild.sh`

Performs a minimal rebuild of only essential packages:

- Removes build artifacts
- Builds only packages needed for:
  - `turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py`
  - `turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py`
  - `explore_lite` (for the explorer)

**Usage:**

```bash
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
./minimal_rebuild.sh
```

**When to use:**

- After making small changes to specific packages
- Faster rebuild times during development
- When you only need to update navigation or exploration components

**Note:** Both scripts automatically source the workspace after building. If you need to manually source the workspace:

```bash
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
```

---

## ROS Domain Configuration

ROS 2 uses `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` to separate different robot networks. Each robot and the Remote PC must use the **same** `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` value to communicate.

**Robot Domain IDs:**

- **Blinky**: `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30`
- **Pinky**: `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=31`
- **Inky**: `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=32`
- **Clyde**: `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=33`

**Setting ROS_DOMAIN_ID:**

**On Remote PC (for each robot connection):**

```bash
# For Blinky
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30

# For Pinky
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=31

# For Inky
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=32

# For Clyde
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=33
```

**To make it permanent (add to `~/.bashrc`):**

```bash
# For Blinky (example)
echo "export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Verify it's set:**

```bash
echo $ROS_DOMAIN_ID
```

**Important:**

- If `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` is not set, ROS 2 defaults to 0
- The Remote PC and robot must use the **same** `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` value
- When switching between robots, make sure to update `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` accordingly

---

## Connecting to a Robot

This section describes the steps to connect to a TurtleBot3 robot and start autonomous exploration. The example uses **Blinky** (ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30), but the same process applies to other robots with their respective domain IDs.

**Prerequisites:**

- Robot is powered on and connected to the network
- Remote PC has ROS 2 Humble installed
- Workspace is built (see [Building the Workspace](#building-the-workspace))
- `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` is set correctly (see [ROS Domain Configuration](#ros-domain-configuration))

**Startup order is critical:** Start terminals in sequence and wait between steps for proper initialization.

---

### Terminal 1: SSH Connection and Robot Launch

**Purpose:** Connect to the robot and launch the robot bringup node.

**Commands:**

```bash
# Set ROS_DOMAIN_ID for Blinky
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30

# SSH into the robot
ssh ubuntu@172.20.10.8
# Password: ubuntu

# After connection, on the robot:
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py
```

**Expected output (if working correctly):**

```text
[INFO] [turtlebot3_node]: TurtleBot3 node has been initialized
[INFO] [turtlebot3_node]: Subscribed to /cmd_vel
[INFO] [turtlebot3_node]: Publishing to /odom, /joint_states
[INFO] [turtlebot3_node]: Publishing to /scan
```

**What to look for:**

- No error messages about device connections
- Messages indicating successful initialization
- Topics should be publishing: `/scan`, `/odom`, `/joint_states`
- Robot should respond to velocity commands

**Verification:**

```bash
```bash
# In a new terminal on Remote PC (with ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30 set)
ros2 topic list | grep -E "(scan|odom|joint_states)"
ros2 topic echo /scan --once  # Should show laser scan data
```

---

### Terminal 2: SLAM Toolbox

**Purpose:** Creates the map as the robot explores using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).

**Commands:**

```bash
# Set ROS_DOMAIN_ID for Blinky
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30

# Setup ROS 2 environment
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger

# Launch SLAM Toolbox
# IMPORTANT: If you see "LaserRangeScan contains X range readings, expected Y" errors,
# you need to use the laser scan normalizer first (see below).

# For faster map updates during exploration, use the fast config:
# Note: Use absolute path or run from workspace root
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py \
  slam_params_file:=$(pwd)/src/turtlebot3/turtlebot3_navigation2/param/humble/mapper_params_online_async_fast.yaml

# Or use default (slower map updates):
# ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py
```

**If you see "LaserRangeScan contains X range readings, expected Y" errors:**

This means your laser sends variable numbers of readings (216-230), causing slam_toolbox to reject most scans. This prevents the map from updating! Use the laser scan normalizer:

**Easy way (recommended):**
```bash
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
./start_slam_with_normalizer.sh
```

**Manual way:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the laser scan normalizer
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
source install/setup.bash
python3 src/turtlebot3/turtlebot3_navigation2/scripts/normalize_laser_scan.py

# Terminal 2: Launch SLAM Toolbox using the normalized scan
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py \
  slam_params_file:=$(pwd)/src/turtlebot3/turtlebot3_navigation2/param/humble/mapper_params_online_async_fast.yaml \
  scan_topic:=/scan_normalized
```

The normalizer will automatically adjust all scans to have exactly 226 readings (matching what slam_toolbox expects), allowing scans to be processed and the map to update properly.
```

**Expected output (if working correctly):**

```text
[INFO] [slam_toolbox]: Node using stack size 40000000
[INFO] [slam_toolbox]: Using solver plugin solver_plugins::CeresSolver
[INFO] [slam_toolbox]: Registering sensor: [Custom Described Lidar]
[INFO] [slam_toolbox]: Slam Toolbox started
```

**What to look for:**

- No error messages about missing topics or nodes
- Messages indicating SLAM Toolbox has started
- After 20-30 seconds, the `/map` topic should appear and start publishing

**Important:** Wait 20-30 seconds after starting SLAM Toolbox before proceeding to Terminal 3. SLAM needs time to:

- Receive scan data from the robot
- Process several scan messages
- Build the initial map
- Start publishing the `/map` topic

**Verification:**

```bash
# Wait 20-30 seconds, then check:
ros2 topic list | grep "^/map$"  # Should show /map topic
ros2 topic echo /map --once      # Should show map data (may need to wait a few more seconds)
```

---

### Terminal 3: Navigation2

**Purpose:** Provides navigation and path planning capabilities, including obstacle avoidance and goal execution.

**Commands:**

```bash
# Set ROS_DOMAIN_ID for Blinky
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30

# Navigate to workspace
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws

# Setup ROS 2 environment
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger

# Launch Navigation2 (includes RViz)
ros2 launch turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py
```

**Expected output (if working correctly):**

```text
[INFO] [nav2_controller]: Creating controller server
[INFO] [nav2_planner]: Creating planner server
[INFO] [nav2_recoveries]: Creating recovery server
[INFO] [nav2_bt_navigator]: Creating BT navigator
[INFO] [nav2_lifecycle_manager]: Creating lifecycle manager
[INFO] [rviz2]: RViz2 started
```

**What to look for:**

- Nav2 nodes starting successfully
- RViz window should open automatically
- You may see warnings about AMCL needing initial pose (this is normal)
- After 20-30 seconds, costmap topics should be available

**Important:**

- Wait 20-30 seconds after starting Nav2 before proceeding to Terminal 4
- **Set the initial pose in RViz** (see below) - this is required for Nav2 to work correctly
- You may see warnings like "AMCL cannot publish a pose" until you set the initial pose

**Setting Initial Pose in RViz:**

1. In the RViz window that opened, click the **"2D Pose Estimate"** button (or press `P`)
2. Click on the map where the robot is actually located
3. Drag to set the robot's orientation (which direction it's facing)

**After setting initial pose:**

- AMCL warnings should stop
- TF transform `map -> base_link` should work
- Nav2 should be ready for navigation

**Verification:**

```bash
# Check Nav2 nodes
ros2 node list | grep nav2

# Check costmap topics
ros2 topic list | grep costmap

# Check TF tree
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo map base_link  # Should work after initial pose is set
```

---

### Terminal 4: Explorer

**Purpose:** Detects frontiers (unexplored areas) and sends exploration goals to Nav2 for autonomous exploration.

**Commands:**

```bash
# Set ROS_DOMAIN_ID for Blinky
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30

# Navigate to workspace
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws

# Start explorer
./start_explorer_simple.sh
```

**Expected output (if working correctly):**

```text
[INFO] [explore_node]: Waiting for costmap to become available, topic: /global_costmap/costmap
[INFO] [explore_node]: Costmap available, starting exploration
[INFO] [explore_node]: Exploration started
[INFO] [explore_node]: Found frontier at (x, y)
[INFO] [explore_node]: Sending goal to Nav2
```

**What to look for:**

- Explorer waits for Nav2's costmap (this is normal - takes 20-40 seconds after Nav2 starts)
- Once costmap is ready, you'll see "Exploration started"
- Explorer will begin finding frontiers and sending goals
- Robot should start moving autonomously

**Important:**

- Start this **after** Nav2 is running and initialized (wait 20-30 seconds after starting Nav2)
- The explorer automatically waits for the costmap - be patient
- Total startup time from robot launch to exploration: ~60-90 seconds

**Verification:**

```bash
# Check explorer node
ros2 node list | grep explore

# Check goals being sent
ros2 topic echo /goal_pose  # Should see goals being published

# Robot should be moving autonomously
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. ROS_DOMAIN_ID Mismatch (Topics Not Visible)

**Symptoms:**

- Topics from robot not visible on Remote PC (or vice versa)
- `ros2 topic list` shows different topics on robot vs Remote PC
- Nodes can't see each other

**Solution:**

1. Check `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` on robot:

   ```bash
   echo $ROS_DOMAIN_ID
   ```

2. Check `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` on Remote PC:

   ```bash
   echo $ROS_DOMAIN_ID
   ```

3. Set the same value on both (e.g., 30 for Blinky):

   ```bash
   export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30
   ```

4. Make it permanent:

   ```bash
   echo "export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30" >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

5. Restart terminals or source bashrc on both systems

**Note:** If `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` is not set, ROS 2 defaults to 0. Make sure both robot and Remote PC explicitly set the same value!

---

#### 2. AMCL Warning: "AMCL cannot publish a pose or update the transform. Please set the initial pose..."

**Cause:** AMCL (localization) doesn't know where the robot is on the map yet.

**Solution:**

1. Open RViz (should open automatically with Nav2 launch)
2. Click **"2D Pose Estimate"** button in RViz toolbar (or press `P`)
3. Click on the map where the robot is actually located
4. Drag to set orientation (which direction the robot is facing)

The warning should stop and AMCL will start localizing the robot.

**Alternative (command line):**

```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /initialpose geometry_msgs/msg/PoseWithCovarianceStamped \
  '{header: {frame_id: "map"}, pose: {pose: {position: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, orientation: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0, w: 1.0}}}'
```

Adjust x, y, z, w values to match robot's actual position.

---

#### 3. Costmap Warnings: "Sensor origin is out of map bounds"

**Cause:** Nav2 doesn't know where the robot is on the map yet, so it can't determine if the sensor is within map bounds.

**Symptoms:**

```text
[WARN] [global_costmap.global_costmap]: Sensor origin at (-0.03, -0.00) is out of map bounds (0.00, 0.00) to (4.98, 4.98)
```

**Solution:**

1. Set the initial pose in RViz (see issue #2 above)
2. Once AMCL knows where the robot is, the warnings will stop
3. Make sure SLAM has published the map first: `ros2 topic echo /map --once`

**Note:** This warning is normal and expected until you set the initial pose. It doesn't prevent Nav2 from working, but you should set the initial pose to resolve it.

---

#### 4. No Map Appearing in SLAM (`/map` topic doesn't exist or not publishing)

**Cause:** SLAM Toolbox not receiving scan data, not initialized yet, or needs more time.

**Symptoms:**

- `/map` topic doesn't appear in `ros2 topic list`
- `/map` topic exists but `ros2 topic echo /map --once` shows "does not appear to be published yet"

**Solution:**

1. Check scan data is available:

   ```bash
   ros2 topic echo /scan --once
   ```

   Should show laser scan data. If not, check robot connection.

2. Check scan frequency:

   ```bash
   ros2 topic hz /scan
   ```

   Should show ~10 Hz (depends on lidar). If 0 Hz, scan isn't publishing.

3. Move robot slightly to help SLAM initialize:

   ```bash
   ros2 topic pub --once /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist '{linear: {x: 0.1}, angular: {z: 0.0}}'
   ```

4. Wait longer: SLAM needs 20-30 seconds AND several scan messages before publishing map
   - The `/map` topic won't appear until SLAM has processed enough scans
   - This is normal - be patient!

5. Verify SLAM is running:

   ```bash
   ros2 node list | grep slam
   ```

   Should show `async_slam_toolbox_node`

6. Check SLAM logs for errors in the terminal where you launched it

**Note:** It's normal for `/map` to not appear immediately. SLAM Toolbox needs to receive scan data, process several scans, build initial map, then start publishing `/map` topic. This typically takes 20-40 seconds from when SLAM starts.

---

#### 5. Explorer Waiting for Costmap

**Cause:** Nav2 costmap hasn't initialized yet (normal - takes 20-40 seconds).

**Symptoms:**

```text
[INFO] [explore_node]: Waiting for costmap to become available, topic: /global_costmap/costmap
```

**Solution:**

- **This is normal!** The explorer is designed to wait. Just be patient.
- The explorer will automatically connect once Nav2's costmap is ready.
- You'll see: `[INFO] [explore_node]: Exploration started` when ready.

**Total wait time:** Usually 20-40 seconds after Nav2 starts, but can take up to 60-90 seconds total from robot launch.

---

#### 6. TF Errors: "Invalid frame ID 'odom' passed to canTransform"

**Cause:** Nav2 started before SLAM Toolbox initialized, or odometry isn't publishing, or initial pose not set.

**Solution:**

1. Set initial pose first (see issue #2 above)
2. Stop Nav2 (Ctrl+C)
3. Verify SLAM Toolbox is running: `ros2 node list | grep slam`
4. Wait 20-30 seconds for SLAM to initialize
5. Check TF tree: `ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo map odom` (should work)
6. Restart Nav2 and set initial pose again

**Prevention:** Always wait 20-30 seconds after starting SLAM before starting Nav2, and set initial pose after Nav2 starts.

---

#### 7. Robot Not Moving / Explorer Not Finding Frontiers

**Cause:** System still initializing, or map too small.

**Solution:**

1. Wait 60-90 seconds total from startup
2. Check explorer status: Should see `[INFO] [explore_node]: Exploration started`
3. Check goals: `ros2 topic echo /goal_pose` (should see goals being sent)
4. Check Nav2: `ros2 service list | grep lifecycle` (should see Nav2 services)
5. Wait for map to build - explorer needs some map data before finding frontiers
6. Verify initial pose is set in RViz

---

#### 8. Two Maps Showing in RViz (Default Test Map + SLAM Map)

**Cause:** Nav2 is loading a default static map file, and SLAM Toolbox is also publishing its live map. Both appear in RViz.

**Solution:**

1. **Option A: Hide static map in RViz:**
   - In RViz, find the "Map" display (there may be two)
   - Disable/hide the one showing the default test map
   - Keep the one showing the live SLAM map

2. **Option B: Use only SLAM map:**
   - In RViz, remove the Map display that's showing the static map
   - Keep only the Map display subscribed to `/map` (from SLAM Toolbox)

**Note:** When doing SLAM/exploration, you typically want to use the live map from SLAM Toolbox, not a static map file.

---

#### 9. Odometry Not Publishing (`/odom` topic exists but no data)

**Cause:** Odometry needs robot movement to initialize, or parameters not loaded.

**Solution:**

1. Move robot slightly:

   ```bash
   ros2 topic pub --once /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist '{linear: {x: 0.1}, angular: {z: 0.0}}'
   ```

2. Check odometry: `ros2 topic echo /odom --once`

3. If still not working, restart robot launch on the robot

**Check:** `ros2 topic list | grep odom` - topic should exist and be publishing data.

---

## Diagnostic Commands

Use these commands to diagnose issues and verify system status:

### Check What's Running

```bash
# List all nodes
ros2 node list

# List all topics
ros2 topic list

# Check scan frequency
ros2 topic hz /scan

# Check map publishing rate
ros2 topic hz /map
```

### Check TF Tree

```bash

ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_monitor

# Check specific transform
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo map base_link

# Check transform between map and odom
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo map odom
```

### Check if Topics Are Publishing

```bash
# Should show laser data
ros2 topic echo /scan --once

# Should show odometry
ros2 topic echo /odom --once

# Should show map (wait a few seconds after SLAM starts)
ros2 topic echo /map --once
```

### Check Nav2 Status

```bash
# List Nav2 lifecycle services
ros2 service list | grep lifecycle

# List costmap topics
ros2 topic list | grep costmap

# Check Nav2 nodes

ros2 topic echo /goal_pose

# Check explorer topics
ros2 topic list | grep explore
```

### Check ROS Domain ID

```bash
# On Remote PC
echo $ROS_DOMAIN_ID

# On Robot (via SSH)
echo $ROS_DOMAIN_ID

# Both should show the same value (30, 31, 32, or 33)
```
